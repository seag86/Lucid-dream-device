# lucid-dream-device
This is device and mobile application, created to help experience lucid dreams.

## How it works
Device measures heartrate with sensor MAX 30102. When you sleep your heartrate is usual low, but when you see the dreams it getting up, pulse data collecting by Arduino nano, which send it to the mobile app using bluetooth low power module HM-10. Mobile app based on react-native platform. When the heartrate is getting over than treshold, it flashes camera torch to your face, so it messages to you in dream, that you in dream.
